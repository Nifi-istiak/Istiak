			Hello there,I love to play games when I was 7 years old maybe,,, I always wanted to complete the game, Sometime games are too hard, And sometimes, well not sometime most of the time happens,,,There are two types of currency, "Gold" and "dimond" or something else. But the most of the things is done by dimond, but there was no way to get dimond,,,Only way to get them is purchase,,,SO i dont have any card to pay,,,Then i try some hacks, 99.99% were fake, Then i listend about mod,,,So i search on youtube,,,i got the green signals,,,50-60% were real...Other 40% were fake youtubers, also they didnt survived long,,,Then i also thought to creaate a youtube, But unfortunetly i was late, When i join the number of youtubers was huge, Then i moved to hindi language,,, well there was much more competition, but i growed a little bit, But I didnt knew that new youtube channel are created with their enimes,,, Then i turned to tech catogory,,,In tech catogory making videos are very easy,,,But geting 10 viewers is like climbing the "Mount everest",,,I uploaded 13 videos, my total views was 560 and watchtime about 2 hours,,, But I uploaded videos in a gap of 1 month so thats mean I uploaded 13 video in a year,,,If I uploaded them regularly then i would have much more views...Then I turned into gaming tech again.But this time in Bangla language...Making videos in gaming category is really very hard,,, But getting views is not harder as tech catagory,,,I uploaded a game Mad zombie as my first video,,,Soon new video will come,,, I was going to make a video on free fire,,,But after I downloaded it i didnt play it. I played it next day but,,,The hollowen update came that day,,,SO i have to cahnge my subject,,,Inshahallah i will grow up my channel,,,I will grow The Bangladesh's Gaming world...I saw a lot of gamers making video in bangla,,,But I found only one channel providing mod game.So to help him I'm joing to the Bd Games comunity,,,
